# Music Genre Classification using various ML Algorithms

Musical genres are categorical labels created by humans to characterize pieces of music. A musical genre is characterized by the common characteristics shared by its members. 
These characteristics typically are related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic content of the music. Genre hierarchies are commonly used to structure the large collections of music available on the Web. 
Automatic musical genre classification provides a framework for developing and evaluating features for any type of content-based analysis of musical signals. 
This work is primarily aimed to create an automated system for classification model for music genres. The first step included finding good features that demarcated genre boundaries clearly. Various features were used for obtaining feature vectors for the classifiers from the GTZAN genre dataset
